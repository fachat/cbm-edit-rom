EditROM Binaries - Updated 2025-01-29
================

ColourPET Binaries folder

These BINARIES for for 80 column PETs MODDED for Colour, using either
a hand-built colour circuit or the ColourPET/Dual PCB.
These are currently 40-column Editor ROMs.

NOTE: Early ColourPET binaries use CODEBASE1. This means you are
====  limited to entering/editing BASIC lines of 40 columns MAX.
      In the near future I will be adding binaries using
      CODEBASE0, which will support proper line-linking for 80
      character (2-lines) long BASIC programs.
