PET/CBM EDIT ROM PROJECT - TODO List
======================== - Updated 2022-04-26

- The 324243-04 ROM appears to bypass the old screen line address tables, and instead calculates the screen pointer,
  and only supports 80-column screen.
- We will have to re-instate those tables in order to support soft-switched Soft-40!!!!
- Continue to add memory variable descriptions (see Commodore's CBM-II source for 'official' labels)
- Analyze extended keyboard scanning routine. Have special codes been modified?
- Document added screen codes for character set switching

- Update extended keyboard matrix tables
	- SHIFT tables need fixing (except for DIN, which is the template)
	- Do we need to add additional tables for "C=" (Commodore Key)?

- ColourPET features:
	- Some ESC codes not working.
	- Some C128 colour codes conflict with PET/CBM codes (ie: SHIFT-ESC)
	- BASIC lines with embedded colour codes cause the colour to change when the program is listed.
	- ColourPET uses ZP variables in TAPE area. Do not use TAPE with ColourPET or find alternate storage locations.
	- ColourPET hardware needs fixing!

- CBM-II keyboard support will require hardware modification.
- Sort out DIN keyboard matrix variations.

- Investigate CRTC parameters for use with RGB/CGA to VGA adapters. Hervé connected his PET to a
  GB8220 board and says the sync width needs adjusting to get a stable picture. His 8032 CRTC
  is initialized with the following registers: 63,40,53,33,33,7,25,32,0,8
	
NOTE: 
      Colour RAM has been relocated to $8800 and hardware will be updated so that 40/80 columns
      can be supported with fixed colour ram locations

Requests:
---------

- Toggle internal/external monitor settings. Hardware control for internal monitor shutoff


Bugs:
-----
- When scrolling a window (using ESC-T for Top) it also scrolls the first character on the line (outside the window)


Future Ideas:
-------------

- Ideas for ColourPET+G board
	- Font support replaces the 4 background bits with 4 character set selection bits (16 posible sets)
	- Support for bold, italic, underline, Double-high, double-wide, double-high+wide text using fonts
	- Plan for 16 font sets:
		- Normal (non-rotated), bold, italic, underline = 4 fonts
		- Rotated = 3 (90/180/270 degrees)
		- Double-high = 2 fonts
		- Double-wide = 2 fonts
		- Double-both = 4 fonts
	- To print a "double" size font we print the same character side-by-side or one above the other
	  but each character is a different font
	- do we want to support this in the editor?????
